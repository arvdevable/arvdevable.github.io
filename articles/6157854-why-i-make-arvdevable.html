            <p>Music has always been a big part of my life, and as a hobby, I create songs that often incorporate themes of loneliness, self-examination, and the contrast between chaos and beauty. I want to create music that resonates with others and can make them feel something deep within themselves. It's my way of expressing my emotions and connecting with others on a deeper level.</p>
            <p>As I started to create more music, I realized that I needed a name to identify myself as an artist. After much thought, I decided to go with "arvdevable." This name is a combination of three parts that are important to me and reflect who I am as a person and as an artist.</p>
            <p>The first part of my name, "arv," is actually the first three letters of my real name. I wanted to keep a part of my identity in my artist name and incorporate it in a unique way.</p>
            <p>The second part of my name, "dev," is an abbreviation for developer. I've always had a passion for technology and coding, and I started to learn how to code when I first got on the internet. It's a hobby that has stayed with me throughout the years, and I wanted to incorporate it into my artist name as a nod to my interests and hobbies.</p>
            <p>The third part of my name, "able," is a simple yet powerful word. It means that I am able to do anything, and it's a reminder to myself to always strive to be my best self and push myself to achieve my goals.</p>
            <p>Overall, "arvdevable" is more than just a name to me. It's a representation of who I am and what I stand for as an artist. I hope that through my music, I can inspire others to embrace their own identities and pursue their passions, no matter how unconventional they may seem.</p>
